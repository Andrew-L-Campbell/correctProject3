                    <p>Background: <br> Alexander Lake is an aesthetic natural lake located in heavily timbered country 
                        with very little open shoreline. It is 23 acres, 9,360 feet in elevation,
                        with 28 feet maximum depth. Several campsites are present along the northern
                        lake margin. The fishery is sustained by aerial stocking of brook trout. 
                           Angling and Camping pressure is heavy. Will need a high clearence Awd/4wd vehicle.
                    </p>
